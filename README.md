## DAY-2:

  * learnt SELECT to display table and WHERE to filter out the results,
  * Also used Aggregate functions such as SUM() , COUNT(),AVG() to do certain calculations
  * example:-
  
            1.finding the total female employees who are born after 1970

            2.finding count of male and female employees in company database
    
            3.finding out total sales made by each employee

            4.find names of all emp who sold >30,000 to a single client

            5.find all the employees whose salary is greater than average salary

            6.find all the employee who are born in a particular month (like febrauary)
