## DAY-2:
       learnt SELECT to display table and WHERE to filter out the results, Also used Aggregate functions such as SUM() , COUNT(),AVG() to do certain calculations
       example:- finding the total female employees who are born after 1970, finding count of male and female employees in company database,finding out total sales made by each employee
