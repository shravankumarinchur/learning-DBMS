# learning DBMS
 
Hey everyone,I'm here to update my DBMS learning

## DAY-1:
         created a COMPANY database with mutliple tables such as employee , client, works_with, branch supplier table , having foreign key relation, composite keys.. 
## DAY-2:
       learnt SELECT to display table and WHERE to filter out the results, Also used Aggregate functions such as SUM() , COUNT(),AVG() to do certain calculations
       example:- finding the total female employees who are born after 1970, finding count of male and female employees in company database,finding out total sales made by each employee
